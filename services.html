          The Nigerian media and entertainment industry has an estimated value
          of US$4 billion and is growing rapidly, with a significant part of the
          growth in this sector being led by the private sector. Nollywood,

            >Nigeria’s movie industry, was born in 1992 with a US$12,000
            straight-to-video movie and has surpassed Hollywood as the world’s
            second-largest movie industry, right behind India’s Bollywood.
            Thanks to creative young Nigerian artists, similar growth is also
            being seen in the music industry, with Nigerian artists gaining more
            recognition and winning awards outside the country. Our sports
            personalities are equally high profile and have recorded outstanding
            achievements in various sporting endeavours, most notably in
